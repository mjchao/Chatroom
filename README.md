# Chatroom
A web-based chatroom written with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java.

This is my first project involving web development. It is also my first project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The front-end will be written with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The back-end will be written in Java using a Glassfish server. The front and back will be connected with Websockets.

To run this program, import the project into Eclipse. Then

1. Start the server
2. Open login.html in your browser.
3. Login with your desired display name.

And you can use the chatroom. 

This chatroom has been tested with Internet Explorer 10, Firefox v. 37.0.2, and Google Chrome v. 42.0.2311.135 m.

I will also try to figure out how to get the websockets to connect to remote machines.
