# Chatroom
A web-based chatroom written with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java.

This is my first project involving web development. It is also my first project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The front-end will be written with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The back-end will be written in Java using a Glassfish server. The front and back will be connected with Websockets.
